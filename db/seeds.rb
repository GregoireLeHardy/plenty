 As a Runner Up, Kenya Connect will receive $5,000 plus Co-Founder and Executive Director, Kenya James Musyoka will travel to London in March to accept the award and participate in engaging seminars and programs. The award prize will help us launch the Mighty Moringa Tree project at six partner schools. ""We are honored and humbled by this award,"" commented James Musyoka. ""This distinction recognizes the work of Kenya Connect as a leader in innovative programs to strengthen education in rural Kenya.""
 The Mighty Moringa Tree will be launched in January as a project that incorporates environmental stewardship and micro enterprise through planting the drought resistant moringa tree that produces a highly nutritious leaves and seeds that can be brewed as a drink or added to soups and stews. Students will follow in the tradition of Wangari Maathai by planting the trees to help mitigate climate change while creating a highly nutrious food source.
 As a donor to Kenya Connect we thought you'd be excited to hear our news. Your support means that we can continue to provide dynamic programs that prepare our students to be engaged citizens and learners.

By restoring vegetation and the forest, we are helping to combat global warming and helping to reduce runoff water from the hills. The trees will help to reduce landslides and rockslides that have resulted in the loss of life. Reforestation is essential for the overall health and quality of life in the community. Your support is much appreciated as we continue to follow the steps recommended by the local Environmental Protection Agency for reforestation.
